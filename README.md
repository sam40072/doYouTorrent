# search an IP for torrents it has downloaded
this program uses iknowwhatyoudownload.com and beautifulSoup to get torrents downloaded by an ip.

# additional lookups
optionally it can also run a whois scan on the ip to give more information about it

# blocklist
gets the list of domains where the ip is blacklisted

# do not abuse the requests
don't try to send a massive amount of requests. I don't want this tool to be an inconvenience to the original creator of iknowwhatyoudownload.com
